# Offscreen Keyboard

A quick hack to run a numpad on my phone, as my laptop doesn't have one

**NOTE**: This is completely insecure, exposing it to the internet would be a bad idea

Requirements:
* Python
* npm
* The usual dev environment

Usage:
* `./run-dev.sh` to build and start server
* Navigate to server on your phone/other device
* Press buttons
